## Overview

## Description of Files

The following files are contained in the whatsapp-corrections zip file

1. CSV dataset
2. Codebook
3. Replication R files: contains 11 R files in total. To replicate tables and figures in the main manuscript and appendix, run main_manuscript-IJPP.R and appendix-IJPP.R, respectively. These scripts begin by running the other files in order: loaddata.R, then Claim1 through Claim9. Claim1 through Claim9 contain code required to clean the original csv file, create necessary variables and generate a dataframe corresponding to each of the 9 claims in the experiment. If these files have already been run, you do not need to run them again.
